ent-BSore = Bluespace ore
    .desc = rock wirh pieces of bluespace ore

ent-RawBSore = Raw bluespace ore


ent-BSore1= Bluespace ore

ent-MaterialBScrystal = Bluespace crystal
    .desc = Just a bluespace crystal that was not combined with plasma and diamond. It has limited functionality, but with a certain manipulation of the crystal it can distort space, expanding, for example, it inside small objects, and also move jumps shuttles into bluespace

ent-MaterialBScrystal1=Bluespace crystal


ent-BScrystal = Bluespace crystal

materials-bluespacecrystal = Bluespace crystal

ent-MaterialBScrystalArt = Artefactul bluespace crystal
    .desc = A crystal combined with plasma and diamond, capable of manipulating an object's position in space, but becomes very unstable if broken.


ent-MaterialBScrystalArt1 = Artefactul bluespace crystal

ent-BScrystalArt = Artefactul bluespace crystal
